The app supports a poster presented at ISMC 2025, aimed at quantifying the match or characteristics between different memory technolgy and AI workloads.
Memory technology is evaluated with a set of metrics, and so are several neural networks that are commonly employed in AI applications.
These two sets of metrics is combined in a 'Fitness Score' which determines how well a given memory technology matches an AI workload. 

The app is built with [Streamlit](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://blank-app-template.streamlit.app/)

### How to run it on your own machine

1. Install the requirements

   ```
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the app

   ```
